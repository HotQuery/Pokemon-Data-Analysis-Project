This project actually ended up being a great practice with data analysis. Coming out of this, I feel much more equiped to look at CSV and 
other similar files and have some real tools to parse and examine data in a specifc way. While I originally intended to do an analysis
on popular colors for decks in the trading card game Magic the Gathering, I decided to structure the learning process more and focus on 
specifically learning how Pandas works: taking a given data set, and being able to ask some specific questions that could be answered
with the tools Pandas provides. I did a lot of research on Pandas and watched some extensive tutorials going into the variety of methods 
one can employ such as the .mean, .count, and .sum functions which are very useful for representative data. I learned how to read and write 
csv files with pandas, and how to even manipulate data with the dataframe structures. In the dataset that I used, comprised of pokemon, I 
was able to ask questions like "what is the average defense rating for each type of pokemon?" which I was able to answer successfully, 
which will hopefulyl be sufficiently demonstrated in the LICECAP image.

I've included a second smaller project that also used matplotlab, where I practiced using some of the functions there to examine different 
growth rates of countries, and plotting that data on a graph.
